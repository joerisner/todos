# todos

Simple todos app in Rails using Hotwire, Turbo, and Tailwind as a CSS processor - without the need for a single line of custom JavaScript.

# Getting started

1. Clone/download this repository
2. Install the necessary ruby version (defined in `.ruby-version`) and gems (`bundle install`)
3. Run migrations `bin/rails db:migrate`
4. Run `bin/dev` to build Tailwind CSS assets & start a server on port 5000
   - _Future runs can simply be `bin/rails s`, if preferred_
5. Navigate to `localhost:5000` to start adding todos!
